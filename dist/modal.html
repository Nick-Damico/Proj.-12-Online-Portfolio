  <h4 class="modal-proj-title">Project Description</h4>
  <p class="proj-description">In this project I built a mobile first, responsive registration form using a variety of HTML form input types and attributes. The project was designed from a supplied visual mockup for a mobile and desktop layout. The layout was designed for mobile and using CSS media queries to change the layout of the form and page as the viewport widens.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">
    The form was enhanced using HTML5 validation to make sure required fields are filled out and formatted correctly. CSS transition effects were also used for highlighting the look of the form fields when they are "focused" and "blurred".

  <h4 class="modal-proj-title">Project Description</h4>
  <p class="proj-description">In this project I created an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript. The page is built using a mobile first, responsive design. The top of the page has a search area that lets a user type 'keywords' and JavaScript filters the images based on title and description of the photos.
  </p>
  <p class="proj-description">The project was coded entirely in 'Vanilla' JavaScript. This project followed courses on JavaScript Basics as well as jQuery Basics. I decided to strengthen my understanding of the 'basics' by using only 'vanilla' JS for this project. 
  </p>
  <p class="proj-description">A custom lightbox modal was built from 'scratch' and is dynamically added to the HTML on page using DOM manipulation. The lightbox appears on a users click of the thumbnail images, the lightbox has a photo description, and buttons to page through all photos in the gallery. The animations are handled by Velocity.js.

  <h4 class="modal-proj-title">Project Description</h4>
  <p class="proj-description">This project was built with JavaScript and jQuery using the HTML5 video, audio elements and their media API. The video players UI was laid out using supplied icons and svg icons that I designed. 
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">The functionality was added using a mixture of jQuery and 'vanilla' JS. The controls appear on a users mouse 'hover' over the video, and the controls hide on 'hover' out of the video area. The player synchronizes the video and transcript. The transcript also hightlights with the videos 'play' progress and is also interactive and response to a users click on any part of the transcript which takes them to the appropriate place in the video.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">
    This project followed courses of study on 'Object-Oriented' JavaScript, 'Interactive' web pages with JS, and HTML video and Audio. Although I didn't use 'Object-Oriented' programming techniques for this project, my plans are to return soon and redesign using those principles.

  <h4 class="modal-proj-title">Project Description</h4>
  <p class="proj-description">This project is modeled after sites which supply users with information about their accounts, sites like GitHub, Zillow, Mint, and even Treehouse. This 'dashboard' project is a visual representation of a users control panel. It is built with mobile first, responsive techniques. Using media queries, the site has two different layouts depending on viewport width.
  </p>
  <p class="proj-description"> JavaScript and jQuery are used for the functionality that drives the charts, graphs, and form submissions. The widgets for web traffic are displayed with multiple graphs across the app. They're designed with Charts.js and the data is added within the JS file since there is 'no' backend database functionality. The settings section of the app allows a user to change settings and then saves those settings using the localStorage Web API.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">This project followed courses on using Git, Github, and the console. I had no idea how important using a version control system like Git is. This was also one of the most challenging projects to date. It required a lot of additional study and searching to learn Charts.js, as well as the layout was the most complex site I've made so far. Although challenging, it was the most rewarding and enjoyable project this far in the techdegree program.</p>

  <p class="proj-description">
  This project uses jQuery and AJAX to request and display that returned data from both databases and display photos and album artwork in an attractive gallery layout.

  <p class="proj-description">The gallery is built making an AJAX, Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, request. The request returns data from both services using their API's. The gallery layout is a grid of thumbnails and uses a jQuery Plugin, lightbox 2, to display full size images from Flickr and Album artwork from Spotify. The Flickr data includes titles and descriptions of photos, and Spotify data includes artist names and album titles. Both Pages include buttons to sort and filter the data results in the gallery.

  <p class="proj-description">Is there anything more important than a sites performance? It can be a great Web APP but if it is a bandwidth 'hog' a majority of potential users may be unable to functionally use the APP as intended. How about these numbers, 47% of users expect a page to laod in 2secs. or less, 40% abandon a site if it takes > 3secs, and 79% of users unhappy with a shopping sites performance will be less likely to return.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">With this Project, I applied the skills and tools I learned for optimizing images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized page and reduce the total load size to under 1.3mb and to improve overall performance.
  </p>
  <p class="proj-description">This project before optimization made over 43 server requests, had 11mb worth of files, and took over 20secs to load. Using best practices and tools such as, Chromes Developer panel and Gulp.js I made major reductions to those numbers. The final project makes only 22 requests, transfers 920kb, and loads within under 500ms.

  <p class="proj-description">Local Ski Report is a CLI Ruby gem for finding the most recent ski report from a selected ski area or resort in North America. It uses the Nokogiri gem to scrape the most recent data from the website www.onthesnow.org. This project was the first of six final projects required for graduation at Flatiron School full stack developer program. It followed lessons in HTML, CSS, Procedural Ruby, Object Oriented Ruby Programming.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">The interface helps the user find the desired ski area by narrowing down choices by region and state. The report is displayed in a table based layout utilizing the Terminal-table gem for formatting data. The report has an initial listing which includes, number of slopes open, recent snowfall and this data can be expanded with a command of 'more'. I'm currently in the process of adding 3-day weather forecast to the gem.
