  <h4 class="modal-proj-title">Project Description</h4>
  <p class="proj-description">In this project, I built a mobile first, responsive registration form using a variety of HTML form input types and attributes. The project was designed from a supplied visual mockup for a mobile and desktop layout. The layout was designed for mobile first and using CSS media queries to change the layout of the form and page as the viewport widens.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">
    The form was enhanced using HTML5 validation properties to make sure required fields are filled out and formatted correctly. Utilizing CSS property transition and pseudo-states, I added effects for highlighting the look of the form fields when they are 'focused' on and grow and shrink on changing of the viewport.

  <p class="proj-description">A custom lightbox modal was built from scratch and is dynamically added to the HTML on the page using DOM manipulation. The lightbox appears on an event click by the user on the thumbnail images, it contains a photo description, and buttons to page through all photos in the gallery. The animations are handled by Velocity.js.

  <p class="proj-description">This project is modeled after sites which supply users with information about their accounts, sites like GitHub, Zillow, Mint, and even Treehouse. This web app dashboard project is a visual representation of a users control panel. It is built with mobile first, responsive techniques. Using media queries, the site content moves and shifts to accommodate the viewport of all devices while maintaining a visually nice looking and usable interface.
  </p>
  <p class="proj-description">JavaScript and jQuery are used for the functionality that drives the charts, graphs and forms submissions. The widgets for web traffic are displayed with multiple graphs across the app. They're designed with Charts.js and the data is added within the JS file since there is no backend database. The settings section of the app allows a user to change settings and then saves those settings using the localStorage Web API.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">This project followed courses on using Git, Github, and the console. It is hard to imagine coding now without the use of a VCS. This was also one of the most challenging projects to date. It taught me the importance of good documentation and searching through that documentation to learn and utilize a technology like Charts.js. The layout was the most complex site I've made so far as well. Although challenging, it was the most rewarding and enjoyable project this far in the techdegree program.</p>

  This project uses JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX requests to display API response data from both services and display photos and album artwork in an attractive gallery layout.

  <p class="proj-description">The galleries are built by making an AJAX, asynchronous JavaScript and XML request. The request responds with data from both services using their API endpoints. The gallery layout is a grid of thumbnails and uses a jQuery Plugin, lightbox 2, to display full-size images from Flickr and Album artwork from Spotify. The Flickr data includes titles and descriptions of photos, and Spotify data includes artist names and album titles. Both Pages include buttons to sort and filter the data results in the gallery.

  <p class="proj-description">Is there anything more important than website performance? It can be a great Web APP but if it is a bandwidth 'hog' a majority of potential users may be unable to use the Apps functionality as it was intended. How about these numbers, 47% of users expect a page to load in 2 seconds, or less. And 40% of users abandon a site if it takes greater than 3 seconds to load, 79% of users unhappy with a shopping sites performance will be less likely to return.
  </p>

  <p class="proj-description">With this Project, I applied the skills and tools I learned for optimizing images, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized page and reduce the total load size to under 1.3mb and to improve overall performance.
  </p>
  <p class="proj-description">Prior to optimization, this website made over 43 server requests, had 11mb worth of data being transferred and took over 20 seconds to load. Using best practices and tools such as, Chromes Developer panel and Gulp.js I made major reductions to those numbers. The final project makes only 22 requests, transfers 920kb, and loads within under 500ms.

   <p class="proj-description">
     The application I built is named, 'Forest Dhamma'. Where the API Rails backend serves and stores associated model data of talks from the International Thai Forest Buddhist monasteries, the front-end is built using React and Redux and functions as an audio player for the talks.

   <p class="proj-description">
     Aside from functioning as an audio player, the application allows a user to 'tag' talks by assigning it a category which will be used to filter talks by in a future update. The monasteries are sorted by React in order of the user likes they accumulate. 
   </p>
   <p class="proj-description">
     I have also added a form to allow users to upload their own favorite talks to the database along with API documentation to explain to the user how to access the database endpoints for contributing and to utilize the resources for their own projects.
